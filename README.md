# photon
it can't do much rn other than render a 3d cube, but i plan on adding all the cool stuff like textures, lighting, model processing, etc.
this isn't really meant to be used by anyone else, but u can try if u want.

# issues
one weird issue is resizing the window to be really small too fast will crash (probably due to a delay in the update of window size, causing it to draw stuff outside of the screen)

# building steps
this was made for my pc which runs linux, so idk if it'll work on windows.
1. make sure u have sdl2 installed (i installed it through my pkg manager, see sdl2's wiki on how to do that)
2. follow the steps in HOWTOCOMPILE.txt (it's a nightmare so gl)
